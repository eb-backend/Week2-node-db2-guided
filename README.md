# DB II Guided Project

## RECAP
* create an actual database - structure, the columns, datatype, tables.. etc
* ask yourself 4 quesions when designing schemas
    * what field or columns does a table need/ what data are we storing in the ds
    * whats the idenfitying key (primary key )
    * are there any restrictions/ what type of data rae we storing
    * are there restrictions for each column

* created db3 file from scratch, writing out the raw sql, writing out in ddl command, executing it in table plus (MANUAL WAY) -> drawback (time, mistakes can be made easily, not reusable, no version control, changes to our schema are not reversible)
* Introducing Database migrations, schema migrations
* We learned how to configure knex - tell how to connect to the db file is
* used seeds to fill in sample data
